    <h2>Major Research Areas - Independent Researcher India</h2>
    
    <h3>Ready Reckoner Series</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Ready Reckoner Series</strong> represents a comprehensive collection of accessible reference frameworks. The series includes the <strong>Hinduism Ready Reckoner</strong> and <strong>Hindu Ready Reckoner</strong>, which provide evidence-based, quick-reference guides to understanding Hindu philosophy, practices, and culture while <strong>debunking myths</strong> about <strong>Hinduism</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sanatana Darshana: A Ready Reckoner for Hindu Dharma</strong> (October 2025) is the <strong>first comprehensive ready reckoner specifically designed for ex-Muslims, atheists, and agnostics</strong>. This groundbreaking work presents <strong>Hindu philosophy through evidence and reason</strong> rather than faith, exploring <strong>Hindu ethics, karma, dharma, cosmology, meditation, caste, and gender roles</strong> using <strong>rational analysis and verifiable sources</strong>. It promotes <strong>interfaith understanding, critical thinking, and spiritual inquiry without requiring belief</strong>, serving as a model for religious education that prioritizes reason over conversion.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal Literacy Framework for Indian College Students</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Legal Literacy Framework for Indian College Students</strong> is an innovative educational framework designed to enhance constitutional awareness and legal literacy among Indian youth. This framework addresses the critical gap in civic education and empowers students with knowledge of their rights and responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Public Safety through Neural-Powered Predictive Security</h3>
    <p>
      Research on <strong>Public Safety through Neural-Powered Predictive Security</strong> explores AI-driven approaches to community safety, combining machine learning with ethical governance frameworks. This work addresses predictive policing while ensuring accountability and preventing algorithmic bias.
